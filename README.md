## Experience

Most recently, I served as a Mobile Software Engineer (iOS Specialist) at 808 Partners, Inc., where I have led the redesign of the Muunifi application, developed a dynamic theme switcher, spearheaded the development of the LBH beauty products application, and assisted in the backend migration for the Tether app.

My previous experiences include my time as an iOS Developer Student at Devmountain, where I implemented a social workout experience feature in "GymBuddy" app and developed user-friendly applications using Xcode, Obj-C, and Swift. I also had the opportunity to serve as a Tech Specialist and Missionary at The Church of Jesus Christ of LDS, where I led the adoption of technological best practices and mentored team members to foster a collaborative work environment.

With my wide range of experiences and proven skills, I am a strong candidate for any iOS development position, and am ready to leverage my skills to contribute to innovative and exciting projects.

## Education

I graduated from Devmountain, Lehi UT in 2021 with a certificate in iOS Software Development.
