### Muunifi

I undertook a holistic overhaul of the Muunifi application's design, deploying React Native's Animation along with custom dynamic styling components. This transformation led to an unprecedented and intuitive design that boosted user engagement and overall satisfaction. Furthermore, I engineered a versatile theme switcher for the Muunifi application using React Native and TypeScript, providing users the flexibility to select their preferred dark or light modes, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

## Experience

Presently, I serve as a Mobile Software Engineer (iOS Specialist) at 808 Partners, Inc., where I have led the comprehensive redesign of the Muunifi application, developed a dynamic theme switcher, spearheaded the development of the LBH beauty products application, and assisted in the backend migration for the Tether app.

My previous experiences include my time as an iOS Developer Student at Devmountain, where I implemented a social workout experience feature in "GymBuddy" app and developed user-friendly applications using Xcode, Obj-C, and Swift. I also had the opportunity to serve as a Tech Specialist and Missionary at The Church of Jesus Christ of LDS, where I led the adoption of technological best practices and mentored team members to foster a collaborative work environment.

With my wide range of experiences and proven skills, I am a strong candidate for any iOS development position, and am ready to leverage my skills to contribute to innovative and exciting projects.
